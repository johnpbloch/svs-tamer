#YouTube Tamer

You know how sometimes you just don't like something a site does with a new iteration of their design? Well I don't like the default home page view of YouTube. The videos I care about get drowned out by recomendations from YouTube and Social shares that I've already seen on Google+ anyway.

So I wrote a Chrome extension to redirect the more annoying feeds to the Subscription feed.

##Installation

Because I'm not interested in publishing this on the Chrome Web Store, you'll have to install it manually. Here's a step by step instructional guide:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/johnpbloch/svs-tamer.git ~/svs-tamer
   ```
1. Open Chrome's extensions page (chrome://extensions)
1. Make sure Developer Mode is enabled (there should be a checkbox in the top right corner)
1. Click "Load unpacked extension..."
1. Select the `svs-tamer` directory
1. ...
1. Profit!
