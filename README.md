#YouTube Tamer

You know how sometimes you just don't like something a site does with a new iteration of their design? Well I don't like the default home page view of YouTube. The videos I care about get drowned out by recomendations from YouTube and Social shares that I've already seen on Google+ anyway.

So I wrote a Chrome extension to redirect the more annoying feeds to the Subscription feed.

##Installation

I suggest installing from the chrome web store, but you can also install this as an unpackaged extension from source.
